`BioNetGen <https://bionetgen.org/>`_ is software designed for modular, structure-based modeling of biochemical reaction networks.
It can be applied to many other types of modeling as well.
It provides a simple, graph-based syntax that lets users build reaction models out of structured objects that can bind and undergo modification.
